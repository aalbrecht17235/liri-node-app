# Liri Bit
Similar to Siri, the Liri bot will take in commands and provide responses. 

## Description

Liri searches the following APIs: Spotify, OMDB, or Bands In Town based on which command it receives. The three commands it accepts are 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this', and 'concert-this'. After taking in the command and either an artist, song, or movie, Liri will output to the terminal the first result of the queried API.
